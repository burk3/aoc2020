# Advent of Code 2020

Mix of languages, sometimes with multiple implementations.

## Day 1
First implementation in Golang.

## Day 2
First implementation in Golang. Went back and did it again in C using `mmap` because I'd never used it before. Fun times!

## Day 3
Python. Nothing too special, except I got a kick out of extending `list` to make a row that wraps to avoid arithmetic.

## Day 4
Python again. I just used regex to validate all the fields because none of the validations looked too complicated. They all fit under 80 chars!

## Day 5
Python again. I just replaced `F` and `L` with `0`s, `B` and `R` with `1`s and mathed on that. Part 2 gets it's own file and just prints out all of the unoccupied seats and lets me use my human-ness to pick the right answer.

## Day 6
First in Python fairly succinctly. Then in Elixir because I wanted to do at least one in a functional-ish language.
